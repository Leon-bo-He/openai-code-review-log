The provided git diff records show changes to two files: `.github/workflows/main-marven-jar.yml` and `openai-code-review-sdk/src/main/java/cn/bobo/sdk/OpenAiCodeReview.java`. Below is a review of the changes:

### `.github/workflows/main-marven-jar.yml`

- **Change**: The workflow file now includes an environment variable `GITHUB_TOKEN` which is used by the `Run code review` job.
- **Impact**: This change allows the `java -jar ./libs/openai-code-review-sdk-1.0.jar` command to access GitHub secrets for authentication.
- **Note**: It is important that the `GITHUB_TOKEN` secret exists in the GitHub repository's secrets, otherwise, the job will fail.

### `openai-code-review-sdk/src/main/java/cn/bobo/sdk/OpenAiCodeReview.java`

- **Change**: The `OpenAiCodeReview` class now includes methods to checkout code, perform a code review, and write logs.
- **New Methods**:
  - `writeLog(String token, String log)`: Writes a log to a GitHub repository. It checks out a repository, creates a new file with a random name, writes the log, and then commits and pushes the changes.
  - `generateRandomString(int length)`: Generates a random string of a specified length to use as a filename.
- **Environment Variable**: The class now requires the `GITHUB_TOKEN` environment variable, which is used for authentication when pushing to the GitHub repository.
- **Potential Issues**:
  - The `writeLog` method uses a hardcoded URL for cloning the log repository (`https://github.com/Leon-bo-He/openai-code-review-log`). This URL should be replaced with a variable or a placeholder that can be set during the workflow configuration.
  - The method does not handle exceptions that might occur during the Git operations, which could lead to unhandled exceptions and failed jobs.
  - The method assumes that the GitHub token has the necessary permissions to clone, write, commit, and push to the specified repository.
  - The method does not include any error handling for file write operations, which could lead to the job failing if there are issues with file permissions or disk space.

### General Observations

- **Security**: The use of a GitHub token for Git operations is appropriate, but ensure that the token has the minimal required permissions and is managed securely.
- **Error Handling**: The code should include proper error handling for all external operations (e.g., Git operations, HTTP requests) to prevent the job from failing silently.
- **Logging**: It would be beneficial to have more detailed logging throughout the code to help with debugging and understanding the workflow's execution.
- **Documentation**: Ensure that the code and the workflow are well-documented, especially for any new features or changes, to facilitate maintenance and future updates.

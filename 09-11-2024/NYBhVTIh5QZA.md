Based on the `git diff` records provided, here is a review of the changes made to the `ApiTest.java` file:

### Changes:
- The test method `test` has been updated. The previous code attempted to parse an integer from a string that contains non-numeric characters ("aaaaa1123"). The current code has been changed to parse an integer from a string that is purely numeric ("4568").

### Code Review:

#### Potential Issues:
1. **Handling of Non-Numeric Strings**: The previous code was attempting to parse a string with non-numeric characters into an integer, which would throw a `NumberFormatException`. This has been addressed by providing a numeric string, which is a good practice.
2. **Hardcoded Test Values**: The new string "4568" is hardcoded into the test. This might not be an issue for this particular test, but it's generally good practice to avoid hardcoded values when possible. Instead, consider using constants, environment variables, or some form of configuration that can be easily changed without modifying the code.
3. **Output to Standard Output**: The test is currently using `System.out.println` to output the result. This is generally fine for debugging purposes, but in an actual test, you might want to assert the value instead of printing it. This way, the test framework can check the correctness of the output rather than relying on manual inspection.

#### Recommendations:
1. **Assert Instead of Print**: Modify the test to assert the value instead of printing it. This will make the test more reliable and automated.
   
   ```java
   @Test
   public void test() {
       assertEquals(4568, Integer.parseInt("4568"));
   }
   ```

2. **Use Constants for Numeric Values**: If this number is used elsewhere or could be reused in other tests, consider defining it as a constant.

   ```java
   private static final int NUMERIC_STRING_VALUE = 4568;
   ```

3. **Error Handling for Parsing**: If there is a chance that the test could receive a non-numeric string in the future, you might want to add error handling to deal with potential `NumberFormatException`.

   ```java
   @Test
   public void test() {
       try {
           assertEquals(NUMERIC_STRING_VALUE, Integer.parseInt("4568"));
       } catch (NumberFormatException e) {
           fail("NumberFormatException was thrown for a numeric string.");
       }
   }
   ```

These changes would improve the robustness and maintainability of the test code.
